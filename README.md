`uscheme` is a personal hack.  There's nothing terribly interesting here
at the moment.

You know how the XP people talk about "code katas"?  This is like that.
Sometimes I've just got to hack together a partial Scheme implementation
for the fun of it.

This one's a bit weird: It doesn't support the full range of Scheme data
types at run time, limiting itself to fixnums, floats and booleans.  My
goal isn't to build a useful programming language, but rather to explore
certain implementation questions with as few moving parts as possible.
